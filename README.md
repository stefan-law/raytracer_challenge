My implementation of the "Ray Tracer Challenge" using Python and a Pytest testing framework (currently in process)

Skills learned:
-implementation of dunder methods
-implementation of abstract data types using OOP

Planned enhancements:
-use of concurrency and multiprocessing methods to improve rendering speed
-optimize code with linear algebra and dynamic programming algorithms to improve rendering speed
